database.ts - Database Service Layer
Acts as an abstraction over Supabase operations
Provides type-safe database methods
Handles error wrapping and validation
Used by API routes and services
Methods match business operations (createPodcast, updateStatus, etc.)
Example:
)
supabase.ts - Database Client Configuration
Creates and configures the Supabase client
Sets up type information for the database
Manages connection credentials
Single source of truth for database connection
Example:
)
The relationship:
supabase.ts configures HOW we connect
database.ts defines WHAT we do with the connection
Routes/services use database.ts, never supabase.ts directly



et me analyze how these files are used:

Database Layer:
lib/database.ts: Service layer for Supabase operations
Used by routes and services
Provides type-safe methods (createPodcast, updateStatus)
lib/supabase.ts: Client configuration
Used only by database.ts
Never used directly by routes/services

Routes:
routes/podcasts.ts: Handles podcast creation
Uses DatabaseService for storage
Uses QueueService for job creation
routes/summaries.ts: Handles summary retrieval
Uses DatabaseService for fetching
Uses transforms for client-side data

Services:
services/api-service.ts: Main orchestrator
Uses DatabaseService for storage
Uses platform clients for metadata
Uses QueueService for jobs

Config:
config/environment.ts: Environment validation
Used by all services for config
Single source of truth for env vars
