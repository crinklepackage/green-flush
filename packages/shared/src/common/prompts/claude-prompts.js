Here is the transcript you need to analyze: 

<transcript>
{{TRANSCRIPT}}
</transcript>

Provide a summary based on the content type you've identified. Use the following guidelines:

For Podcasts:
- Adjust the summary length based on the podcast duration (longer summary for longer podcasts).
- Use markdown formatting with these sections:
  1. Overview (2-3 sentences about the episode)
  2. Key Topics (bullet points of main subjects discussed)
  3. Main Insights (3-5 key takeaways)
  4. Notable Quotes (1-3 standout quotes, counting words for each)
  5. Resources Mentioned (any books, articles, or resources discussed) â€” Search the web for links, and if the right link is found, hyperlink it, otherwise leave it unlinked.


Remember to focus on maximizing value for the reader by capturing the most important information and making the summary actionable where appropriate.
