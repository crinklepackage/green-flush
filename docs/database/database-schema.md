Based on the image, here are the table relationships in plain words:

1. The "profiles" table:
- Connected to auth.users.id through its id
- Contains username, email, and timestamps
- This is the user profile information

2. The "reading_list" table:
- Connected to profiles through user_id
- Connected to summaries through summary_id 
- Tracks when items were created
- This represents what summaries users have saved to read

3. The "failed_youtube_searches" table:
- Contains Spotify-related data (url, title, show_name)
- Includes search query information
- Tracks resolution status and YouTube URL results
- Records timestamps for creation and resolution

4. The "user_summaries" table:
- Connected to profiles through user_id
- Connected to summaries through summary_id
- Tracks when summaries were added
- This represents user-specific interactions with summaries

5. The "summaries" table:
- Connected to podcasts through podcast_id
- Contains extensive metadata about the summary (status, key_points, notable_quotes, etc.)
- Tracks processing status, costs, and timestamps
- Contains error handling and retry information

6. The "podcasts" table:
- Main table for podcast information
- Connected to auth.users.id through created_by
- Contains basic podcast metadata (url, title, show_name)
- Includes platform-specific information and media details

The main flows show that:
- Users (profiles) can have reading lists and user summaries
- Podcasts have summaries
- Summaries can be saved to reading lists
- Failed searches are tracked separately
- Everything ties back to the authenticated user (auth.users.id)
