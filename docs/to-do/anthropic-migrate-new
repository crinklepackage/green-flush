Our current worker code uses the Anthropic SDK’s completions.create call—which maps to the legacy Text Completions endpoint 1. That’s why the prompt is required to start with "\n\nHuman:".
The new API (the Messages endpoint as documented here) uses a different format (usually messages as an array of roles and contents). Migrating to that would mean reworking how we format our prompt, likely by constructing a series of messages (e.g., one from the Human and one from the Assistant) instead of a single prompt string.
So, to answer your question:
Yes, our current implementation is using the legacy endpoint, which is why the prompt formatting fix (prepending "\n\nHuman:" if necessary) is correct.
If we decide in the future to adopt the new messages API, we’d need to rewrite our prompt-building logic to conform to the new schema (and call the corresponding method on the SDK).
For now, given our codebase and the worker logs, the change is appropriate. If you want to eventually migrate to the new endpoint, we can plan that migration as a separate phase.
