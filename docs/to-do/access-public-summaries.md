Based on my analysis of your codebase, here's how summary access is currently controlled:
Current Security Model
Access Control is Enforced: Your application has a proper security model for summaries. The userHasAccessToSummary method in database.ts checks if a user has access to a specific summary by verifying if there's an entry in the user_summaries table linking that user to that summary.
API Endpoint Protection: The API route for getting a summary by ID (GET /api/summaries/:id) correctly checks if the user has access using:

`   const hasAccess = await db.userHasAccessToSummary(userId, summaryId)
   if (!hasAccess) {
     return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Summary not found' })
   }`

   Database RLS Rules: Your Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policy for user_summaries only allows a user to see their own records where user_id = auth.uid().
Security Concern
The concern you raised is valid. There are two potential approaches for your application:
Strict Access Control (Current Model)
Users can only access summaries that are explicitly linked to them in the user_summaries table
This is secure but limits discoverability and sharing
Mixed Access Model
Private summaries: Only accessible to linked users
Public/discoverable summaries: Accessible to any authenticated user
Recommendation
If you want to implement a feature to surface "You might like this summary" recommendations, you'll need to modify your security model:
Add a "Visibility" Column:
   ALTER TABLE summaries ADD COLUMN visibility TEXT DEFAULT 'private' CHECK (visibility IN ('private', 'public'));

   Update Access Control Logic:
      async userHasAccessToSummary(userId: string, summaryId: string): Promise<boolean> {
     // First check if this is a public summary
     const { data: summary } = await this.supabase
       .from('summaries')
       .select('visibility')
       .eq('id', summaryId)
       .maybeSingle();
       
     if (summary?.visibility === 'public') {
       return true;
     }
     
     // If not public, check if user has explicit access
     const { data } = await this.supabase
       .from('user_summaries')
       .select('*')
       .eq('user_id', userId)
       .eq('summary_id', summaryId)
       .maybeSingle();
       
     return !!data;
   }

   Admin Controls: Add admin controls to set summaries as public/private
This approach maintains security while enabling the recommendation feature you're considering.
Would you like me to implement these changes to support both private summaries and discoverable/public summaries?
