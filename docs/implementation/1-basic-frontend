Proposed Incremental Plan
1. Set Up Local Development Environment:
Initialize the Next.js client using Yarn to ensure consistency with our workspace.
Configure environment variables (e.g., for Supabase) for local development.
Ensure Vercel-specific or local configurations are properly accounted for.

2. Basic Page Routing:
Marketing/Homepage:
Create a landing page (e.g., pages/index.tsx) that can serve for static marketing content.
Authentication Pages:
Create placeholder pages for login and signup (e.g., pages/auth/login.tsx and pages/auth/signup.tsx).
Dashboard:
Set up the app dashboard page (e.g., pages/app/index.tsx) with a simple URL submission form.
Summary Details:
Create a summary details page (e.g., pages/app/[id].tsx) to display the progress and results of a summary.

3. Basic Functionality Without Full Implementation:
UI Placeholder Elements:
Put in simple components so that each page displays basic, static content.
Supabase Connection Configuration:
Set up and verify that the Supabase client is connecting correctly.
Routing Verification:
Ensure that navigation between pages (marketing, auth, dashboard, summary) works correctly.

4. Incremental Feature Development:
URL Submission Flow:
Start by having the URL submission form create an initial summary record (even a dummy record) and redirect to the summary page.
Auth Integration:
Add proper authentication flows as soon as the basic routing is in place.
Real-Time Updates:
Prepare a basic setup to show real-time updates (e.g., via Supabase realtime or an SSE endpoint) on the summary page.
Summary Viewing:
Once backend endpoints and worker processing are integrated, display the live summary text and status updates.
Next Steps
Would you like me to show you how to set up the Next.js client with basic routing first, including placeholder pages and the Supabase connection?
That way, we can get a solid foundation locally before incrementally adding more functionality.
