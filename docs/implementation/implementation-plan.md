# Comprehensive Project Status and Roadmap

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- **Basic Architecture & Structure:**
  - Three-package separation (shared, server, client) implemented.
  - Clear delineation of API vs Worker responsibilities.
  - Core types and configurations established.
  
- **Frontend:**
  - Basic page routing completed: Marketing/Homepage, Authentication (login/signup), Dashboard, and Summary pages.
  - The summary page (`/app/[id]`) loads and displays live data via Supabase realtime subscriptions.
  - Supabase integration on the client is working with the configured anon key.

- **API:**
  - Podcast submission endpoint (`POST /api/podcasts`) implemented.
  - URL validation using YouTubeService, metadata fetching from YouTube, and podcast record creation via DatabaseService are functional.
  - Enqueuing of processing jobs to QueueService is operational.

- **Worker:**
  - Basic worker process is running and correctly picking up jobs from the queue.
  - Initial job processing logic (for transcript fetching and further processing) is in place.

- **Observability & Integration:**
  - Supabase connections established on both frontend (anon key) and server (service key).
  - Real-time updates on the summary page have been verified.

## üèóÔ∏è IN PROGRESS:
- **Core Implementation:**
  - Enhancing the URL submission flow to dynamically update summary records.
  - Further integration of the worker processor for transcript fetching and summary generation.
  
- **Frontend Enhancements:**
  - Refining error messaging and loading states.
  - Integrating authentication for secure access (login/signup) to enhance summary management.
  
- **API Enhancements:**
  - Adding additional endpoints for summary retrieval and streaming of updates.
  - Expanding validation and error handling based on production use cases.

- **Infrastructure & Quality:**
  - Writing additional unit tests for platform services and API endpoints.
  - Initial work on setting up a CI/CD pipeline.
  - Enhanced logging and error tracking partially integrated.

## üìö DOCUMENTATION:
- Developer instructions, code standards, and contributing guidelines are being updated.
- API documentation and architecture diagrams are under review.
- Integration and deployment procedures are being refined.

## NEXT STEPS:
- **Testing & Validation:**
  - Complete end-to-end testing of the flow from URL submission to podcast record creation and job processing.
  - Monitor job processing in the worker and validate transcript/summary generation.
  
- **Integration Enhancements:**
  - Integrate external services (e.g., Supadata, Claude) for transcript fetching and summary streaming.
  - Expand error handling, retry mechanisms, and add comprehensive logging.
  
- **UI/UX & Authentication:**
  - Finalize the URL submission form and summary page UI improvements.
  - Roll out authentication integration for secure summary access.
  
- **DevOps & Observability:**
  - Establish and refine a CI/CD pipeline.
  - Set up performance monitoring and structured logging dashboards.

üìù **Main Areas to Tackle Next:**
- **Frontend Core:** Final touches on URL submission and summary display pages.
- **Worker Core:** Complete transcript and summary processing logic.
- **API Core:** Implement additional endpoints for summary status and real-time streaming.
- **Testing & Documentation:** Augment tests for full flow coverage and finalize internal developer guides.
