Dependency Management Strategy

1. Workspace Structure
Our monorepo uses Yarn workspaces:
packages/
├── client/        # Frontend package
├── server/
│   ├── api/      # API package
│   └── worker/   # Worker package
└── shared/       # Shared package

2. Adding Dependencies

CORRECT:
# From root directory (preferred method)
yarn workspace @o3/api add @supabase/supabase-js
yarn workspace @o3/client add react-query
yarn workspace @o3/worker add bullmq

# Alternative: from package directory
cd packages/server/api
yarn add @supabase/supabase-js

INCORRECT:
❌ Running yarn install in individual packages
❌ Installing shared dependencies in multiple packages
❌ Installing service-specific deps in root package.json

3. Dependency Principles

a) Package Independence
- Each package should manage its own dependencies
- Dependencies should be declared where they're used
- Avoid duplicate dependencies across packages

b) Shared Dependencies
- Common utilities go in shared package
- Types used by multiple packages go in shared
- Core libraries used everywhere should be in root

c) Examples:
CORRECT:
- @supabase/supabase-js in api package (API-specific)
- bullmq in worker package (Worker-specific)
- typescript in root (used by all)
- @types/node in root (used by all)

INCORRECT:
- @supabase/supabase-js in root (service-specific)
- react in worker (frontend-only)
- shared types in individual packages

4. Installation and Updates

Always run these commands from root:
yarn install          # Install all dependencies
yarn upgrade         # Update all dependencies
yarn clean          # Clean all node_modules

Never run in individual packages:
❌ cd packages/api && yarn install
❌ cd packages/worker && yarn upgrade

5. Dependency Resolution
- Yarn workspaces handles dependency hoisting
- node_modules are primarily in root
- Package-specific node_modules only contain unique deps

6. Version Management
- Lock files are managed at root level
- Package versions are managed in individual package.json files
- Shared dependencies should use same version across packages
