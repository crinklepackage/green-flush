Monorepo Management:
Yarn workspaces (we strictly use Yarn, not NPM)

Backend (Server & Workers):
Node.js with TypeScript
Express for API endpoints
Background job processing (using tools like bullmq/ioredis for queues)

Supabase for authentication and database integration
Integration with external APIs (Spotify, YouTube) for metadata and transcript processing
AI summary generation using Claude Streaming (via Anthropic’s SDK)

Frontend:
React application, built using Next.js
Additional client package for a Chrome extension (browser-specific logic)
Uses shared browser-safe modules from our shared package

Shared Modules:
Common business logic, types, constants, and utilities—split into browser and Node entry points
This setup provides a modular, scalable stack that cleanly separates platform-agnostic and platform-specific code.
