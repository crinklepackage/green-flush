Podcast Streaming Request Flow
==============================

Overview:
The podcast processing implementation will follow a modular approach with a two-phase plan.

Phase 1: DB-Backed Streaming
-----------------------------
1. The API POST /podcasts endpoint extracts the podcast URL and determines the platform type.
2. A podcast record is created in the database with status IN_QUEUE.
3. A corresponding summary record is created with status IN_QUEUE.
4. A job is enqueued using BullMQ, passing the podcast and summary IDs along with the URL and type.
5. The worker processes the job, generating summary chunks.
6. Each summary chunk is appended to the summary record in the database.
7. The client receives real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions, displaying streaming chunks as they arrive.

Phase 2: Direct Streaming via SSE
-----------------------------------
1. Implement an SSE endpoint in the API to stream summary chunks directly to the client.
2. Core processing logic remains unchanged; only the delivery mechanism is abstracted.
3. After validating Phase 1, allow switching between DB-backed streaming and SSE.
4. The SSE endpoint will offer lower latency direct streaming while ensuring data integrity.

Transition and Future Improvements:
-------------------------------------
- Start with Phase 1 for its reliability, persistence, and ease of debugging in local development.
- Transition to Phase 2 (SSE) to improve performance and user experience as needed.
- Develop a ContentProcessorService that wraps the existing processing logic and abstracts the delivery mechanism, enabling a smooth switch between DB and SSE streaming.

Required Environment Variables:
----------------------------------
- REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT, etc., for Redis connection in job queue processing.
- Ensure all necessary Supabase-related variables are set for database real-time subscriptions.

This plan aligns with our modular and scalable architecture principles, ensuring clear separation of concerns and flexible, incremental improvements.
